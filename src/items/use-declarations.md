A _use declaration_ creates one or more local name bindings synonymous with
some other [path]. Usually a `use` declaration is used to shorten the path
required to refer to a module item. These declarations may appear in [modules]
and [blocks], usually at the top.

[path]: ../paths.md
[modules]: modules.md
[blocks]: ../expressions/block-expr.md

Use declarations support a number of convenient shortcuts:

* Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix, using the
  glob-like brace syntax `use a::b::{c, d, e::f, g::h::i};`
* Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix and their common
  parent module, using the `self` keyword, such as `use a::b::{self, c, d::e};`
* Rebinding the target name as a new local name, using the syntax `use p::q::r
  as x;`. This can also be used with the last two features:
  `use a::b::{self as ab, c as abc}`.
* Binding all paths matching a given prefix, using the asterisk wildcard syntax
  `use a::b::*;`.
* Nesting groups of the previous features multiple times, such as
  `use a::b::{self as ab, c, d::{*, e::f}};`

## `use` Visibility

Like items, `use` declarations are private to the containing module, by
default. Also like items, a `use` declaration can be public, if qualified by
the `pub` keyword. Such a `use` declaration serves to _re-export_ a name. A
public `use` declaration can therefore _redirect_ some public name to a
different target definition: even a definition with a private canonical path,
inside a different module. If a sequence of such redirections form a cycle or
cannot be resolved unambiguously, they represent a compile-time error.

An example of re-exporting:

```ds
mod quux {
    pub use self::foo::{bar, baz};
    pub mod foo {
        pub fn bar() {}
        pub fn baz() {}
    }
}

fn main() {
    quux::bar();
    quux::baz();
}
```

In this example, the module `quux` re-exports two public names defined in
`foo`.

## Underscore Imports

Items can be imported without binding to a name by using an underscore with
the form `use path as _`. This is particularly useful to import a trait so
that its methods may be used without importing the trait's symbol, for example
if the trait's symbol may conflict with another symbol.

Asterisk glob imports will import items imported with `_` in their unnameable
form.

```ds
mod foo {
    pub trait Zoo {
        fn zoo(&self) {}
    }

    impl<T> Zoo for T {}
}

use self::foo::Zoo as _;
struct Zoo;  // Underscore import avoids name conflict with this item.

fn main() {
    let z = Zoo;
    z.zoo();
}
```

The unique, unnameable symbols are created after macro expansion so that
macros may safely emit multiple references to `_` imports. For example, the
following should not produce an error:

```ds
macro m {
    ($item: item) => { $item $item },
}

m!(use std as _;);
// This expands to:
// use std as _;
// use std as _;
```
